    <h2>🧰 Tools Used</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Claude AI:</strong> For generating initial code snippets and logic.</li>
        <li><strong>DeepSeek:</strong> For debugging and optimizing the code.</li>
        <li><strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript:</strong> Core technologies used to build the extension.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🚨 Challenges Faced</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Debugging:</strong> What was supposed to be a 30-minute project turned into a 2.5-hour debugging session. Turns out, vibe coding isn’t always as smooth as it sounds!</li>
        <li><strong>Learning Curve:</strong> As a college student, I realized the importance of understanding the code rather than just relying on AI tools.</li>
    </ul>
