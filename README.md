🧰 Tools Used
Claude AI: For generating initial code snippets and logic.

DeepSeek: For debugging and optimizing the code.

HTML, CSS, JavaScript: Core technologies used to build the extension.

🚨 Challenges Faced
Debugging: What was supposed to be a 30-minute project turned into a 2.5-hour debugging session. Turns out, vibe coding isn’t always as smooth as it sounds!

Learning Curve: As a college student, I realized the importance of understanding the code rather than just relying on AI tools.
